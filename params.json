{"name":"Lambda","tagline":"Our Code, written by sheeple","body":"### Welcome to Lambda's Code Page!\r\nWe have several autonomous scripts and a single teleop script. We won't show you the gritty details, but here are the cool bits, such as clever algorithms and workarounds, etc. \r\n\r\n### Teleop: Right Beacon Slammer\r\nWith about 20 lines of code, programmer Andy Zhang (@andrewmzhang) developed a set of conditionals that allow our double jointed right side beacon hitting arm to move up and down using 2 buttons despite having 2 servos. Also note that the arm slams down on the beacon with more speed than it retracts. This script makes it easy on the driver, since he does not have to worry about controlling the directionality of two servos, only about slamming the arm. Gif below:\r\n\r\n \r\n### Distance tracking\r\nWithin the autonomous, we have a function that allows the robot to position itself the proper distance away from the coloured beacon. The while loop moves the robot forwards and backwards to ensure that the robot is within the accepted interval away from the coloured beacon before performing the dump. Gif below:\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe programs were written and tested by these team members: Andrew Zhang (@andrewmzhang), Alan Shen (@roboticsenthusiast) Andrew Chen (@dsetreg), Hari Subbaraj (@hsubbaraj), and Abdulvasey Mohammed (@furkhan324).\r\n\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-74384929-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
